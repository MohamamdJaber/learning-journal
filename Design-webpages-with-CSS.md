# how CSS works:
* Css is a very usefull tool to change color to create a beatifull pages with a greate texts,colors and to make every thing clear.
>* for example to change the fonts in css just type this command < h1, h2, h3 {
font-family: Arial;
color: yellow;}
* for change the colors only you should write <color: the color you want;>....as we told its easy.
## Now we should know that:
1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
2. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
3. The HTML and the CSS each one integrate each other.
4. there are many colors and styles dont forget to try them all.
