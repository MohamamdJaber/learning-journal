## Mind set
*A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort;
intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.
A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.*
>This concept struck a chord with me because I discovered that when I try things, I often get only so far before encountering a challenge and stopping.
Behaving this way is all well and good when it comes to rock climbing, or judo, or kite surfing (a few of many activities I’ve failed to master), but when it comes to my work, it’s a problem.
