# script what is and where can we use it:
 it is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
##  Expressions:
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
just like + ,- ,*,%,and so what.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script and have a relation with each other with expression.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
### Functions:
Grouping together the statements that are required to needs to perform in order to of a 
answer a question or perform a perform its task are packaged file.
Thats what functions do.
```
function (name){
    variables;
}
```
also some times we need to put return (The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller.)
there are many functions and you need only to invoke them after defined.
