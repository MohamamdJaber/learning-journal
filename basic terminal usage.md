# Basics and advantage of terminal (Ex:Linux) usage :
>First of all terminal usage means that just a small screen that make us do different things by only a simple sympoles
onle by typing this sympoles over it.
## For example : 
1.  **pwd**
:Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
1. **ls**
:List the contents of a directory.
1. **cd**
:Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
#### Other things that we should know about it:
1. *Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.*
1. *Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.*
1. *Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.*
1. *To make a file or directory hidden all you need to do is create the file or directory with it's name beginning with a . or rename it to be as such. Likewise you may rename a hidden file to remove the . and it will become unhidden. The command ls which we have seen in the previous section will not list hidden files and directories by default. We may modify it by including the command line option -a so that it does show hidden files and directories.*
